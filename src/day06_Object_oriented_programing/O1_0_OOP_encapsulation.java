/* Wrapping of a data and methods in a single unit is called encapsulation.so that any other class can't access it directly
 * they have to call method to access data.
 * 
 * advantages
 * #access restriction is provided. --  class/object is the implementation unit.
 * #implementation independence.
 * 
 * object- real world entities or thing which have state, behavior, identity
 * ex. your dog, your cat etc.
 * 
 * A software object is a bundle of variables(state) and methods(operations).
