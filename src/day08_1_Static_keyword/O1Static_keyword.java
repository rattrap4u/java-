//         --------Static Keyword--------
//static keyword is applicable to variables,methods and blocks.
// variables--data members that are static and non-static
// methods -- are also static and non-static(instance methods)
// constructors -- can't be static or non-static. because constructor constructs the object.
//  as constructor has nothing to do with class.
//  object is not required to call a static method. that's why our main method is static.
//  jvm has to call the main method with the name of the class. 
// static can't access non-static data or method indirectly by using objects we will access non-static data.
